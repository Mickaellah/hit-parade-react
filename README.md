## Overview

## Built With

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)


## Features

In this project, I work with react to create an app for popular music. There are quite a lot of pages in this project. There is the popular songs page which is the home page where you can find a list of songs.

## How does it work

There are two arrows in each list, one is an up arrow and the other one is a down arrow. They act like buttons, they are used to like or unlike a song. There is a shopping cart icon which leads you to the cart page and where you can see the price of the song, they price is just number that we add so they are not the correct price.

There is an add page where you can see a form for adding a new song to the list in the popular songs page. There is one last thing in the popular song and that is the three dotes, they are links that brings you to a lyrics page where you can find the lyrics of the song which you have clicked. There is one last page and that is the the style page, there are numbers of styles in this page and if you click to one style, it will show all the songs that have that style.
